# Algorithm-of-TAD-clustering
Identifying the 3D structure of folded chromatin is of crucial importance for understanding how DNA spatial organisation affects genome functionality and transcription.

The implemented algorithm, introduced by A. Rubinov (2017), builds a hierarchical tree on given Hi-C contact matrices, and provides methods to calculate the differences between such trees.
